## Introduction

This project is focused on building a macOS AI agent that leverages both local software and web capabilities. It is powered by [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) and [macOS-use](https://github.com/browser-use/macOS-use). Currently, the agent supports OpenAI and GEMINI API keys, with plans to soon support local LLMs running with Ollama. 

The AI agent is particularly effective at performing simple tasks such as clicking buttons on the web and in applications, thanks to its strong integration with the DOM tree and OS accessibility. However, its ability to perform operations on files like Google Docs and PDFs is currently limited. Future updates will allow the AI to leverage additional tools to improve its performance in these areas.
